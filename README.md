#### React Web Socket Chat App
This is a simple implementation of a online chat system using React, Redux and React Router. Consuming an Socket.io WebSocket endpoint.

The boilerplate was made with Create React App, but since some customized settings were needed, the app was ejected.

The UI was built with Material-UI v0.20.0 and some custom SCSS styling.

To run the project:

##### Development mode
`$ npm install `

`$ npm start` 

##### Production mode (build)
`$ npm install`

`$ npm run build`
